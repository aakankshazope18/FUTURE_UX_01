UI/UX Design Task 1 – Fitness Trainer Website

-----Fitness Trainer Website – UI/UX Design (Task 1)
-- Project Overview

This project is a conversion-focused website UI design created for a Personal Fitness Trainer, as part of UI/UX Design Internship – Task 1.
The goal of the website is to generate leads and encourage users to book a free fitness consultation through clear CTAs, trust-building sections, and a clean user flow.
The design focuses on usability, visual hierarchy, and mobile responsiveness, simulating a real-world local service business website.

-- Problem Statement

Many local fitness trainers rely on social media or word-of-mouth, lacking a professional website that clearly communicates their services and converts visitors into leads.
This project addresses that gap by designing a high-conversion, user-friendly website that:
Clearly explains services
Builds trust with users
Encourages consultation bookings

-- Target Users

Individuals aged 18–40
Beginners starting their fitness journey
Busy working professionals
Students looking for personal or online fitness coaching

-- UX Approach & Key Design Decisions

Clear Call-to-Action (CTA):
“Book Free Consultation” is prominently placed across all pages to guide users toward the main conversion goal.
Trust Building:
Trainer introduction, certifications, testimonials, and transparent service information help reduce hesitation.
Simple User Flow:
The website follows a logical flow:
Understand services → Build trust → Take action
Mobile-Friendly Design:
Sections are vertically stacked, buttons are touch-friendly, and content is easy to scan on smaller screens.
Strategic Use of Background Images:
Background images are used only in hero and CTA sections with overlays to maintain text readability.
